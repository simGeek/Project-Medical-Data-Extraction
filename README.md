# Project-Medical-Data-Extraction

1. Context & Importance
Developed a Medical Data Extraction system to automate the process of extracting useful information from medical documents in PDF format.
📌 Why is it important?
Hospitals often need to extract information for tasks like insurance claims and record management. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, so automation can significantly improve efficiency.

2. Technologies Used
🛠 Tech Stack: Python, Regular Expressions (basic NLP), Computer Vision
🔍 Key Methods:
PDF to Image Conversion
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for Text Extraction
Pattern Recognition with NLP & Regex

3. Role & Tasks
Implemented:
✅ PDF to Image Conversion for better processing
✅ OCR & Text Processing to extract meaningful data
✅ Custom Rule-Based Extraction to handle different document structures

4. Challenges & Solutions
⚡ Challenge: Different PDFs had unique structures, making consistent extraction difficult.   
   -> Prescription
   -> Patient Details
   -> Vaccination Record
   -> Medical History
💡 Solution: Developed custom processing for each document type to ensure accuracy.

6. Impact & Results
🚀 Automated the process, reducing manual effort by 80%
⚡ Cut down data extraction time by 95%
💰 Lowered operational costs by reducing manual labor
